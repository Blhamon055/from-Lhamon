My favorite food is Au Gratin also known as Scalloped Potatoes. They're super cheesy and honestly I love most things potato anyway.
Mashed Potatoes was one of my favorite things growing up. In fact when my family had chicken noodle soup, we would put mashed potatoes under it too.
As of recently I noticed that's not a super common thing, if common at all.








But here's the direct image that shows what I mean:
